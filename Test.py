'''
A module to test the supyr_struct library and definitions.
When called by itself it will run a pre-configured test.
The test parameters can be modified by providing keyword
arguments when creating a class instance.

'Tag_Tag_Class' is intended to be an easy way to test
Definitions, Constructors, Tag_Objs, Tag_Blocks,
Tag_Types, Readers, Writers, Encoders, and Decoders
by providing your own Constructor to the class upon
creating an instance.

            Keyword arguments:
            
            #bool
            Save_Test ------- Whether or not to call self.Write_Tags() to save
                              all tags after they are loaded.
                              Default is False
            Print_Test ------ Whether or not to loop over all tags after they
                              are loaded and print each one.
                              Default is True

            #dict
            Print_Options --- A dict containing keywords that determine how
                              to print the tags if 'Print_Test' is True.
                #bool
                Printout -------- If True, prints the tags line by line rather
                                  than the whole tag at once. This is done so
                                  that even if certain sections of the tag
                                  fail to properly print, most of it will.
                                  Default is True
                                  
                Print_Raw ------- If True, prints 'Raw' Tag_Types. Raw data is
                                  unencoded and would take up unnecessarily
                                  large amounts of screen space is shown.
                                  Default is False

                #int
                Indent ---------- The number of spaces indent each level of
                                  hierarchy when printing nested structures.
                                  Default is 4 spaces.
                Precision ------- The number of trailing zeros to print floats
                                  to by using str.format(). Default is 3.
                                  If set to None, no formatting will be done.

                #set
                Show ------------ A set of keywords that determine what is
                                  shown when a tag is printed. A keyword being
                                  present in the set means it is printed.
                    Keywords:
                    
                    Tag_Path ---- Prints the Tag.Tag_Path
                    Bin_Size ---- Prints the tag size if it were written
                    Ram_Size ---- Prints the amount of ram the tag takes up.
                                  Two lines will be printed, one which shows
                                  the size of just the Tag_Data, and another
                                  which shows the size of the Tag_Data and
                                  the Tag_Obj that contains it.
                    
                    Name -------- Prints the name of the attribute
                    Type -------- Prints the name of the Tag_Type
                    Value ------- Prints the data itself
                    Offset ------ Prints the offset(if it applies)
                    Size -------- Prints the datas size
                    Unique ------ Prints if the descriptor is unique
                    Children ---- Prints all of the children in a tag
                    Elements ---- Prints the enumerator meaning of the value
                    Flags ------- Prints the flags, their masks, and names


                    If Bin_Size and Ram_Size are both true, an extra two lines
                    will be printed which compare the Bin_Size to the Ram_Size
                    The printout will look like this:
                    "In-Memory Tag Object" tag is X.XXX times as large.
                    "In-Memory Tag Data" tag is X.XXX times as large.

                    Where X.XXX is a float whose precision is determined by
                    the Print_Option 'Precision'.

            print(Tag), but has the advantage of not causing an exception that
            will prevent the entire tag from being shown. This usually occurs if
            a character in the stringified Tag maps to an undefined character.
            This mode prints the tag almost line by line and any exceptions
            that occur are noted in the printed tag.
