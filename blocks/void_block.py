'''
A module that implements VoidBlock, a subclass of Block.
VoidBlocks are used as placeholders where a Block is
required, but doesnt need to store any unique objects.

    attributes or other unique objects actually need to be stored.

    For example, VoidBlocks are used as the default Block
    created when no default is set in a Switch descriptor.
