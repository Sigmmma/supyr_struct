Since the word 'descriptor'(or the shorthand 'desc') is thrown around
in supyr so often, I thought it would be best to explain what it is in
a single readme rather than have it spread throughout multiple modules.

Also, I am aware that the word 'descriptor' already has a python specific
meaning. I had already been using it for a year before I found out though.
I've decided to keep using it since the word fits perfectly and I cant
imagine people accidentally confusing the two(at least not for very long).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are descriptors?

Descriptors are nothing more than dictionaries used for describing
an object that represents some sort of binary data or structure.
All descriptors have a 'TYPE' key with a FieldType instance in it.
The TYPE entry provides the most general of the attributes used to describe
the object. The other entries in the descriptor provide the more specific
attributes, such as the objects name and offset in a structure.

Descriptors should be immutable, as a single descriptor is intended
to be referenced by many thousands of objects(or more). When a descriptor
is created by a BlockDef, the BlockDef converts it into a FrozenDict.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where/how are descriptors used?

Here are the main places in the library that use descriptors
and a brief summary of how/why they use them.

###  Blocks  ###
################
All Blocks store a reference to a descriptor in the __slot__ 'desc'.
This descriptor is used to 'describe' the Block and the nodes in it.

Descriptors are also used while building/serializing nodes so that
functions know what to read/write, where to read/write it, how to
read/write it, and they are used to describe how certain attributes
rely on others(an int specifying a strings length for example).


###  BlockDefs  ###
###################
BlockDefs store in their 'descriptor' attribute the descriptor
which they have generated. A BlockDef gives this descriptor to
the first Block they create when their 'build' method is invoked.


###  Other descriptors  ###
###########################
Descriptors are also, by necessity, stored inside other descriptors.
For example, a descriptor describing a struct also stores descriptors
for the members of the struture, like ints, floats, strings, etc.

When a descriptor is meant to describe some kind of object that is not
a Block, the descriptor must be inside another descriptor, which is
itself inside a Block. This may sound confusing, so here's an example:

asdf = Struct('some_struct',
     UInt8('some_int8'),
     UInt16('some_int16'),
     UInt32('some_int32')
     )

asdf will be a descriptor that contains descriptors for the nodes
'some_int8', 'some_int16', and 'some_int32'. While a Struct can be expressed
as a ListBlock(and can thus have a descriptor), the int attributes of the
struct are regular python ints, which cannot have extra attributes.

When a Block is built and its descriptor contains descriptors for other
nodes(child nodes), the descriptors of these children are given to them
as a reference when they are created. Because of this, a Block is able
to build any other Blocks contained in it since it has their descriptors.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do descriptors do?

The main thing they do is provide static attributes and attribute alias's.

Descriptors store a dictionary under the key 'NAME_MAP', which maps
the given name of each node in a Block to the attribute name it
can actually be found under. For ListBlocks, this can also instead
be the index in the list that the node is actually located in.

To better understand, here is the __getattr__ method of Block:

def __getattr__(self, attr_name):
    try:
        return object.__getattribute__(self, attr_name)
    except AttributeError:
        desc = object.__getattribute__(self, "desc")

        if attr_name in desc['NAME_MAP']:
            return self[desc['NAME_MAP'][attr_name]]
        elif attr_name in desc:
            return desc[attr_name]
        raise AttributeError("'%s' of type %s has no attribute '%s'" %
                             (desc.get('NAME', 'UNNAMED'),
                              type(self), attr_name))

As you can see, one can refer to nodes in a Block by alias names
stored in the NAME_MAP, and one can also access values in
the descriptor as if they were attributes in the Block.

These two lines function the same:
    asdf = some_block[some_block.desc['NAME_MAP']['some_attribute']]
    asdf = some_block.some_attribute

These two lines also function the same:
    qwer = some_block.desc['TYPE']
    qwer = some_block.TYPE

In this way, descriptors act similarly to an objects __dict__, but without
the ability to edit it freely.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is this "descriptor" concept even needed?

###  Memory efficiency  ###
###########################
Most reasons for this system all stem from memory efficiency. When you have
ten thousand identical structures(albeit with differing contents) you incur
a huge ugly overhead for all attributes that are ALWAYS shared between them.

Descriptors were invisioned as a way to give objects generic attributes that
can be reused without any memory overhead. The NAME_MAP descriptor entry
combined with a ListBlock take this a step further. The NAME_MAP allows the
objects in the lists indices to be accessed by a name, but a list only uses
4 bytes per index(32bit reference pointer). This allows ListBlocks to have
mutable named attributes at only the 4 byte cost of referencing the object.

This is also why Blocks implement __slots__; one for a descriptor, one for
the parent of the Block, and(sometimes) one for a steptree.


###  Independent functioning  ###
#################################
The other important reason for this system is that it allows Blocks to carry
a context around with them which enables them to function independently from
whatever parser built them. Because the parsing/serializing system exists
entirely in the descriptor, Blocks can parse/serialize themselves without
requiring an outside object to do it for them.

This also allows intermixing Blocks that are identical when serialized.
For example, one could replace an ip address Block that contains 4 UInt8
fields with a Block containing a string formatted as "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd"(so
long as the serializer converts the string to 4 bytes before writing it).


###  Globally variable attributes  ###
######################################
While this is not something that anyone should use unless they have a VERY
good reason to, there is another thing they allow; modifying globally shared
attributes. FrozenDicts are made to be as immutable as possible while keeping
the same speed as a dict, so they still function as a dict under the hood.
While the __setattr__ and __delattr__ methods have been overridden to prevent
changes, one can still call dict.__setattr__ or dict.__delattr__ to override
the immutability.

I cannot emphasive enough that this is bad practice, but in the cases where
one has thousands of structures that must be converted to some other structure
and then serialized, it's far faster to edit the descriptor temporarily.
Again, this is NOT good practice and is very dangerous, but it has its uses.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is in a descriptor?

Only two types of keys are expected to be in a descriptor; ints and strings.

A minimal descriptor contains 'TYPE' and 'NAME' entries. If the descriptor
is intended to describe a Block, it must also have a 'NAME_MAP' entry. The
TYPE entry is a reference to the FieldType instance which provides most of the
static attributes to describe the node. The NAME entry is simply a string
that the node is referenced by when in another Block.


###  Integer keys  ###
######################
Integers keyed entries are other descriptors which make up ordered entries
in the node that the descriptor is intended to describe. Most of the time
these ordered entries are other nodes within the node, but for some Blocks
like EnumBlock and BoolBlock they can be descriptions of options and
settings that the Block can be set to. It all depends on the Block.


###  String keys  ###
#####################
String keyed entries vary in purpose, but they are mostly supplementary
information that helps describe the node. For example, the 'SIZE' entry
is intended to store something specifying the serialized size of the node.
'SUB_STRUCT' on the other hand, stores a descriptor which is given to each
of the nodes in the ArrayBlock. If the SUB_STRUCT descriptor has a Switch
FieldType as its TYPE entry, you basically have an array of mixed node types.

Different Block subclasses may each have different requirements on what
should be in their descriptor. Using the example from before, ArrayBlocks
must have a SUB_STRUCT entry in their descriptor. This SUB_STRUCT entry
is used for building more Blocks in the array and/or knowing how to
treat/serialize the data when the objects contained in the ArrayBlock are
not Blocks themselves.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are all the entries that can be used in a descriptor?

This is mostly copied from the supyr_struct.defs.constants.py
file, but with a few edits and extra information.


These are the most important and most used keywords

NAME ----------- The given name of a node. This is copied into the NAME_MAP
                 entry in the nodes parents descriptor.
                 Must be a string.

TYPE ----------- The FieldType that best describes the node.
                 Must be a FieldType.

SIZE ----------- Specifies an arrays entry count, a structs byte size, 
                 the length of a string, the length of a bytes object, etc.
                 Must be an int, function, or a nodepath.

SUB_STRUCT ----- The descriptor to repeat in an array or the
                 descriptor that is wrapped in a StreamAdapter.
                 Must be a descriptor.

CASE ----------- Specifies which descriptor to use for a Switch field.
                 Must be an int, function, or a nodepath.
                 If used in a WhileArray, this must be a function
                 and must return a bool specifying whether or not
                 another Block should be built.

CASES ---------- Contains all the different possible descriptors that can
                 be chosen by the Union/Switch block it is enclosed in.
                 CASE determines which key to look for the descriptor
                 under. If the descriptor doesnt exist under that key,
                 a VoidBlock with a void_desc is built instead.
                 Must be a dict.

VALUE ---------- The value of a specific enumerator/boolean option.
                 If not specified, one will be deduced. The position 'i'
                 is the integer key of the option in the descriptor plus
                 the amount of padding before it. For bools, VALUE will
                 default to '2**i'. Otherwise it will default to 'i'.
                 Must be an int, str, or bytes.

DECODER -------- A function used to decode and return a Buffer for
                 a StreamAdapter field before it is handed off
                 to be parsed by the StreamAdapter's SUB_STRUCT.
                 Also returns how much of the input stream was decoded.
                 Must be a function.



These are supplementary keywords that give more control
over creating a structure, how and where to read/write, etc

ALIGN ---------- The byte size to align the offset to before reading or
                 writing. Alignment is done using this method:
                     offset += (align - (offset % align)) % align
                 Must be an int.

INCLUDE -------- This one is more of a convience. When a dict is in
                 a descriptor under this key and the descriptor is
                 sanitized, all entries in that dict are copied into
                 the descriptor if the entries dont already exist.
                 Must be a dict.

DEFAULT -------- Used to specify what the value of some attribute
                 should be in a field when a blank structure is created.
                 Must be an instance of descriptor['TYPE'].py_type, or
                 in other words the py_type attribute of the TYPE entry.

BLOCK_CLS ------ Specifies the Block class to be constructed
                 when this descriptor is used to build a Block.
                 If not provided, defaults to the py_type attribute
                 of the TYPE entry:
                     descriptor['TYPE'].py_type
                 Must be a Block class.

ENDIAN --------- Specifies which endianness instance of a FieldType to use.
                 This is only used by BlockDefs during their sanitization
                 process. If not given, the FieldType that already exists in
                 the descriptor will be used. ENDIAN is carried over into
                 inner descriptors during the sanitization process.
                 Valid values are '<' for little and '>' for big endian.
                 Must be a string.

OFFSET --------- The offset within the structure the data is located at.
                 Meant specifically for struct elements. When a descriptor
                 is sanitized, this is removed from the descriptor it is
                 in and moved into the parent descriptors ATTR_OFFS list.
                 Must be an int.

POINTER -------- Defines where in the buffer to read or write.
                 The differences between POINTER and OFFSET are that
                 POINTER is not removed from the descriptor it's in and
                 POINTER is used relative to the root_offset whereas
                 OFFSET is used relative to the offset of the parent.
                 Must be an int, function or a nodepath.

ENCODER -------- A function used to encode and return the buffer that was
                 written to by the StreamAdapter's SUB_STRUCT attribute.
                 This encoded buffer should be able to be decoded by this
                 same descriptors DECODE function.
                 Must be a function.

STEPTREE ------- A descriptor of a node which is usually described by
                 its parent. STEPTREE nodes arent elements of a structure,
                 but are linked  to it. They are read/written in a
                 different order than the elements of a structure.
                 Parsers and serializers finish processing the tree they are
                 currently in, then proceed to read/write all steptrees
                 encountered in the order that they were encountered.
                 Must be a descriptor.

STEPTREE_ROOT -- Whether or not the current node is
                 a root at which to build steptrees.
                 If True, all nodes with STEPTREE entries within
                 this node will be collected and their steptrees
                 will be read/written at this tree level. This
                 is only valid when used in 'container' fields.
                 Must be a bool.



These are keywords that are mainly used by supyrs implementation
and are always autogenerated by sanitization routines. 

ENTRIES -------- The number of integer keyed entries in the descriptor.
                 Must be an int.

NAME_MAP ------- Maps the given name of each node to the list index or
                 __slot__ name that the node is actually stored under.
                 Must be a dict.

CASE_MAP ------- Maps the given case value of each sub-descriptor in a Union
                 or Switch descriptor to the index it is stored under.
                 Must be a dict.

VALUE_MAP ------ Maps the given value of each possible enumeration value to
                 the index that specific options descriptor is located in.
                 This serves to enable a flat lookup time when trying
                 to determine which enumerator option is selected.
                 Must be a dict.

ATTR_OFFS ------ A list containing the offset of each of structs attributes.
                 Must be a list.

ADDED ---------- A freeform entry that is neither expected to exist,
                 nor have any specific structure. It is ignored by the
                 sanitizer routine and is primarily meant for allowing
                 developers to add their own data to a descriptor without
                 having to make a new descriptor keyword for it.
                 Can be anything.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is with the ALL_CAPS descriptor keys?

This was a design decision based around the way a descriptor is used.
Since the entries in a descriptor are intended to be static, they are
essentially constants, which are typically denoted in all uppercase.

Another reason this was done is so common names like size, name, type,
and value are still available to be used as attribute names in a Block
without having to resort to some awkward use of underscores or whatnot.

The last reason is because it makes it very clear that you are intending to
access an entry in the descriptor(rather than an attribute) when you do:
    some_block.TYPE    or     some_block.NAME
