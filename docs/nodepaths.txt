Nodepaths are an important part of how this library allows
developers to easily describe a relationship between nodes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is a nodepath?

A nodepath is simply a string that details a path
through a tree of nodes to some specific node.
nodepaths are regular python string instances.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How are they used?

Nodepaths can be supplied to a Block's get_neighbor or set_neighbor
method in order to get or set the attribute the nodepath points to.

When a Blocks get_meta or set_meta method is called and the specified
descriptor value is a nodepath, it calls the Blocks get_neighbor or
set_neighbor method using the value in the descriptor as the nodepath.

When a part of supyr_struct needs to get or set something, the get_meta
or set_meta method of the parent Block is called and given the key in
the descriptor to try and get or set. When the descriptor entry is a
nodepath, get_meta/set_meta will chain with get_neighbor/set_neighbor.

This is an example of how the function chain will look:
    # try to get the size of some_block.some_attr
    size = some_block.get_meta('SIZE', 'some_attr')

that will end up running
    return some_block.get_neighbor(some_block.desc['SIZE'])

which will split the nodepath using
    paths = nodepath.split('.')

which will call:
    for attr in paths:
        if attr == '':
            node = node.parent
        else:
            node = node.__getattr__(attr)
    return node

which will return the last attribute pointed to.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How will I know if a string is a nodepath?

By context. Nodepaths are(so far) only expected to found under
three descriptor keys; SIZE, POINTER, and CASE. nodepaths are
just python string instances with the formatting described below.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I make a nodepath?

The most important thing to know is that beginning a nodepath with
a period means to start navigating from the parent of the attribute.
If the nodepath doesnt start with a period, it means to start
navigating from the root of the tree. If the tree is parented to
a Tag instance, the root will be the Tag.

When a nodepath is being navigated, it is first split using str.split('.')

This means that this string:
    "...some.node.attr"
will be split into these strings:
    ('', '', '', 'some', 'node', 'attr')

Since the first period means to start from the current node, the
real path becomes: ( '', '', 'some', 'node', 'attr')
Every empty string means to go to the current node's parent.
Every non-empty string means to go to the attribute of the current node.

That example string could easily have been rewritten as:
    '.parent.parent.some.node.attr'


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is this "nodepath" concept even needed?

Nodepaths were conceived because a lot of the time all that is
needed to specify a size, a pointer, a switch case, or a union
case is the exact value of a field in some neighboring node.

Rather than having to write a function to search for and return(or change)
a node every time you have another node whose description relies on some
ancestor node, it is much easier to write one string which says where
the first node is located.

Take this struct for example:

Container('some_container',
     UInt8('str_len'),
     StrAscii('some_string', SIZE='.str_len'),
     )

This is effectively a pascal string, and can be easily described without
having to write a function to return str_len when reading the string.
Also, when 'some_string' is changed, the 'some_container' node it is in
will use the SIZE nodepath to update str_len to match the new size.
