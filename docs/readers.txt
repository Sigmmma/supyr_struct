Terminology:

Block ------- An object designed to hold and express parsed binary data.

Field ------- An immutable object with serveral properties that describe
              a specific kinda of Block or data. These properties are mostly
              bools, like is_str, is_struct, is_array, is_enum, is_block,
              etc, but there are also properties like 'enc'(for string and
              numerical encodings), 'endian'(the endianness of the bytes),
              and 'delimiter'(the character a string is delimited with).

              They also store a reader(for reading bytes from a buffer),
              a decoder(for turning those bytes into a python object),
              an encoder(for turning a python object into bytes), and a
              writer(for writing those bytes to a buffer).

              See readers.txt, writers.txt, decoders.txt, encoders.txt,
              sanitizer.txt, and sizecalc.txt for more information.

descriptor -- A dictionary which serves as a collection of static attributes
              that describe parsed binary data held in a Block, one
              of these being a Field instance under the key 'TYPE'.

What is a reader?

A reader is a function that serves primarily to 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How are they expected to operate and why?




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where and why are they used?



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What positional and keyword arguments should a reader
function expect and what are their purposes?

required positional:
    self -------- The Field instance whose reader function is being run.

    desc -------- The descriptor that describes the data being read.

keyword:
    parent ------ The Block or Tag that this reader must parent the new_block that
                  it builds to. If attr_index is None, then this is instead the
                  new_block that this reader would build, and instead of building
                  a new_block, the reader will simply re-build it.

    rawdata ----- The buffer being parsed into python objects such as Blocks,
                  ints, floats, strings, etc.

    attr_index -- The index the new_block object that this reader will be building
                  can be found under by doing:
                      parent[attr_index].

    root_offset -- The root offset that all rawdata reading is done from.
                   Pointers and other offsets are relative to this value.
                   Passed to the reader of this UnionBlocks Field.

    offset ------- The initial offset that rawdata reading is done from.
                   Passed to the reader of this UnionBlocks Field.

Reader functions are allowed to be given arbitrary keyword arguments
in order to be as versatile as they need to be. Because of this they must
make use of **kwargs since unused keyword arguments may be provided.
kwargs must be passed to any meta_getter_setters and nested readers being called.
