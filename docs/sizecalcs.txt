Terminology:

Block ------- An object designed to hold and express parsed binary data.
              Blocks act as nodes in trees with the capacity to be a
              parent node, meaning they hold other nodes.

descriptor -- A dictionary which serves as a collection of static attributes
              that describe parsed binary data expressed as a node, one
              of these being a Field instance under the key 'TYPE'.

Field ------- An immutable object with several properties that describe
              a specific kind of node. These properties are mostly bools,
              like is_str, is_struct, is_array, is_enum, is_block, etc,
              but there are also properties like 'enc'(for string and
              numerical encodings), 'endian'(the endianness of the bytes),
              and 'delimiter'(the character a string is delimited with).

              They also store a reader(for reading bytes from a buffer),
              a decoder(for turning those bytes into a python object),
              an encoder(for turning a python object into bytes), and a
              writer(for writing those bytes to a buffer).

              See readers.txt, writers.txt, decoders.txt, encoders.txt,
              sanitizer.txt, and sizecalc.txt for more information.

What is a sizecalc?

Sizecalcs are functions which calculate the size of a type of node.
The units are usually bytes, but are whatever the Fields size is measured in.
Arrays and other container Fields are measured by their number of elements,
bitints are measured in bits, and everything else is measured in bytes.


A sizecalc is usually very simple, like in the following example:

def str_sizecalc(self, node, **kwargs):
    '''Returns the byte size of a string if it were encoded to bytes.'''
    return len(node)*self.size


But they can sometimes get a bit more complex:

def big_sint_sizecalc(self, node, **kwargs):
    '''
    Returns the number of bytes required to represent a twos signed integer.
    NOTE: returns a byte size of 1 for the int 0
    '''
    # add 8 bits for rounding up, and 1 for the sign bit
    return (node.bit_length() + 9) // 8


Or even more complex:

def delim_utf_sizecalc(self, node, **kwargs):
    '''
    Returns the byte size of a UTF string if it were encoded to bytes.

    Only use this for UTF8 and UTF16 as it is slower than delim_str_sizecalc.
    '''
    nodelen = len(node.encode(encoding=self.enc))

    # dont add the delimiter size if the string is already delimited
    if node.endswith(self.str_delimiter):
        return nodelen
    return nodelen + self.size


As you can see though, even the more complex sizecalcs remain fairly simple.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where and why are they used?

A sizecalc is used when a Blocks get_size method is called and SIZE doesnt
exist in the descriptor(it will need to be calculated).

A sizecalc is also called when a Blocks set_size method is called and
a new size is not provided. In this situation the sizecalc is used to
calculate a new value to set the size to.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What positional and keyword arguments should a sizecalc
function expect and what are their purposes?

required positional:
    self -------- The Field instance whose sizecalc function is being run.

    node -------- The node whose size is being calculated.

keyword:
    parent ------ The parent Block of the node argument. This is provided
                  for the scenarios where node is not an instance of Block.
                  If this argument is to be considered valid, attr_index must
                  be provided and valid as well.

    attr_index -- The index that node can be found under in parent by doing:
                      parent[attr_index].
                  If this is None, assume the parent argument is not valid.

Sizecalc functions are allowed to be given arbitrary keyword arguments
in order to be as versatile as they need to be. Because of this they must
make use of **kwargs since unused keyword arguments may be provided.
