Pathstrings are an important part of how this library allows
developers to easily describe a relationship between a Block
(or one of its attributes)and some other attribute.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terminology:

Block ------- An object designed to hold and express parsed binary data.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is a pathstring?

A pathstring is simply a string that details a path
through a tree of Blocks to some specific attribute.
Pathstrings are regular python string instances.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How are they used?

Pathstrings can be supplied to a Block's get_neighbor or set_neighbor
method in order to get or set the attribute the pathstring points to.

When a Blocks get_meta or set_meta method is called and the specified
descriptor value is a pathstring, it calls the Blocks get_neighbor or
set_neighbor method using the value in the descriptor as the pathstring.

When a part of supyr_struct needs to get or set something, the get_meta
or set_meta method of the parent Block is called and given the key in
the descriptor to try and get or set. When the descriptor entry is a
pathstring, get_meta/set_meta will chain with get_neighbor/set_neighbor.

This is an example of how the function chain will look:
    # try to get the size of some_block.some_attr
    size = some_block.get_meta('SIZE', 'some_attr')

that will end up calling
    return some_block.get_neighbor(some_block.desc['SIZE'])

which will split the pathstring using
    paths = pathstring.split('.')

which will call:
    for field in path_fields:
        if field == '':
            block = block.parent
        else:
            block = block.__getattr__(field)
    return block

which will return the last attribute pointed to.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How will I know if a string is a pathstring?

By context. Pathstrings are(so far) only expected to found under
three descriptor keys; SIZE, POINTER, and CASE. Pathstrings are
just python string instances with the formatting described below.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I make a pathstring?

The most important thing to know is that beginning a pathstring with
a period means to start navigating from the parent of the attribute.
If the pathstring doesnt start with a period, it means to start
navigating from the root of the Block tree. If the Block tree
is parented to a Tag instance, the root will be the Tag.

When a pathstring is being navigated, it is first split using str.split('.')

This means that this string:
    "...some.block.attr"
will be split into these strings:
    ('', '', '', 'some', 'block', 'attr')

Since the first period means to start from the current Block, the
real path becomes: ( '', '', 'some', 'block', 'attr')
Every empty string means to go to the current Block's parent. Every
non-empty string means to go to the attribute of the current Block.

That example string could easily have been rewritten as:
    '.parent.parent.some.block.attr'


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is this "pathstring" concept even needed?

Pathstrings were conceived because a lot of the time all that is
needed to specify a size, a pointer, a switch case, or a union case
is the exact value of an attribute in some neighboring Block.

Rather than having to write a function to search for and return(or
change) an attribute every time you have a Block whose description
relies on a previously parsed field, it is much easier to write
one string which says where the attribute is located.

Take this struct for example:

Struct('some_struct',
     UInt8('str_len'),
     StrAscii('some_string', SIZE='.str_len'),
     )

This effectively a pascal string, and can be easily described without
having to write a function to return str_len when reading the string.
Also, when 'some_string' is changed, the 'some_struct' Block it is in
will use the SIZE pathstring to update str_len to match the new size.
