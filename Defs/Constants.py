Below list of alignment sizes was taken from the below url and modified:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment

when compiling for 32-bit x86:
    A char (1 byte) will be 1-byte aligned.
    A short (2 bytes) will be 2-byte aligned.
    An int (4 bytes) will be 4-byte aligned.
    A long (4 bytes) will be 4-byte aligned.
    A float (4 bytes) will be 4-byte aligned.
    A double (8 bytes) will be
        8-byte aligned on Windows
        4-byte aligned on Linux
        4-byte aligned on GCC
    A long long (8 bytes) will be 8-byte aligned.
    Any pointer (4 bytes) will be 4-byte aligned
    Strings are aligned by their character size
        A char size of 1 byte will be 1-byte aligned.
        A char size of 2 bytes will be 2-byte aligned.
        A char size of 3 bytes will be 4-byte aligned.
        A char size of 4 bytes will be 4-byte aligned.

The method this library uses for automatic alignment is
Align = 2**int(ceil(log(Size, 2)))

where Size is the byte size of the data being aligned.
If Align > ALIGN_MAX, it will be set to ALIGN_MAX, which is 8

Because of this, "doubles" must be manually specified as having 4-byte
alignment if imitating Linux or GCC, "long doubles" must be manually specified
as having 2-byte alignment if imitating DMC.
