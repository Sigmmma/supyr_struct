'''
A module that provides several buffers which behave similarly to
file and mmap.mmap objects. Buffer objects implement read, seek, size,
tell, peek, and write methods for getting/modifying their contents.

Also provides a function for getting a Buffer object when given
a rawdata or filepath argument. Intended to be used to obtain
a valid rawdata argument to supply to FieldTypes parser method.

    This function serves as a macro for returning a Buffer object.
    'filepath' and 'rawdata' may be given as keyword arguments.
    Accepts any number of keyword arguments and ignores invalid ones.

    If filepath is given, this function will open the file as a PeekableMmap.
    If rawdata is a bytes object, it will be converted into a BytesBuffer.
    If rawdata is a bytearray, it will be converted into a BytearrayBuffer.
    If rawdata is not a bytearray or bytes and is not None, it will
    be checked to make sure it has read, seek, and peek methods.

    Returns the rawdata, or None if rawdata and filepath were unsupplied.

    Raises TypeError if rawdata and filepath are both provided.
