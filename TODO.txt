CRITICAL THINGS TO DOCUMENT

blocks/block    module
    Block class
        serialize

blocks/array_block    module
    ArrayBlock class
    PArrayBlock class

blocks/list_block    module
    ListBlock class
    PListBlock class

defs/block_def    module
    BlockDef class
        build

tag    module
    Tag class
        parse
        serialize

__init__

Need to write up a simple-ish tutorial on how to use the library

Rename uses of attr_index to field_index?

Need to make an OnDemand FieldType(maybe LazyParser?)
    Might store a reference to the rawdata stream(or a piece of it),
    the size of what to read from it, and the offset to read it from.
    Will also need to store an endianness so it knows if it needs to
    actually parse the data to reverse it or if it can just write it.

Need to make an Mapping FieldType and a DictBlock
    The DictBlock will handle how the keys items are stored and retrieved(and
    whether they are ordered or not) and will need to allow accessing values
    by their names as well as the integer index they are at if they are ordered.

    The parser and serializer will handle parsing and serializing the keys and values.

    They will also determine whether or not the keys and values are interleved.

    Need to figure out how to store the keys and values so the type of key and type
    of value can be determined while parsing/serializing.


Binilla:
    Hex editor window:
        Make it able to be opened in multiple instances and able to be given either a
            chunk of rawdata to edit or a filepath to open and modify
