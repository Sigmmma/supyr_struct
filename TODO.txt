Need to write up a simple-ish tutorial on how to use the library

Rename uses of attr_index to field_index?

Need to figrue out a way to allow Switch FieldTypes to have their widget displayed since
they wont be displayed if no object exists, and also wont be displayed if one does.
This is because Switches dont have a Block they are used by, and they are instead an intermediary descriptor

Binilla:
    Config file
        Last used definitions folder
        Last open tag filepaths matched to their def_id
            Dont include tags whose definitions arent in the last used definitions folder
        Everything in the settings window

    Settings window
        Configurable hotkeys
        Default TagWindow size
        Tiling and cascade steps
        Settings for how tags are written(write to temp, backup original)

    Hex editor eindow:
        Make it able to be opened in multiple instances and able to be given either a
            chunk of rawdata to edit or a filepath to open and modify

    TagWindow manager window
