'''
A class for organizing and loading collections of tags of various Tag_IDs.

Handlers are meant to organize large quantities of different types of
tags which all reside in the same 'Tags_Directory' root folder. A Handler
contains methods for indexing all valid tags within its Tags_Directory,
loading all indexed tags, writing all loaded tags back to their files, and
resetting the Tag_Collection or individual Cls_ID collections to empty.

Handlers contain a basic log creation function for logging successes
and failures when saving tags. This function can also rename all temp files
generated during the save operation to their non-temp filenames and logs all
errors encountered while trying to rename these files and backup old files.

        Keyword arguments:
        
        #type
        Constructor -- The Constructor class that this Handler
                       will use to build any and all tags. After it is
                       built, self.ID_Ext_Mapping is set to the
                       ID_Ext_Mapping of self.Constructor.
                           
        #int
        Debug ------------ The level of debugging information to show. 0 to 10.
                           The higher the number, the more information shown.
                           Currently this is of very limited use.
        Rename_Tries ----- The number of times that self.Get_Unique_Filename()
                           can fail to make the 'Tag_Path' string argument
                           unique before raising a RuntimeError. This renaming
                           process is used when calling self.Extend_Tags() with
                           'Replace'=False to merge a collection of tags into
                           the Tag_Collection of this Handler.
        Tags_Indexed ----- This is the number of tags that were found when
                           self.Index_Tags() was run.
        Tags_Loaded ------ This is the number of tags that were loaded when
                           self.Load_Tags() was run.
        
        #str
        Tags_Directory --- A filepath string pointing to the working directory
                           which all our tags are loaded from and written to.
                           When adding a tag to Tag_Collection[Cls_ID][Tag_Path]
                           the Tag_Path key is the path to the tag relative to
                           this Tags_Directory string. So if the Tags_Directory
                           string were 'c:/tags/' and a tag were located in
                           'c:/tags/test/a.tag', Tag_Path would be 'test/a.tag'
        Log_Filename ----- The name of the file all logs will be written to.
                           The file will be created in the Tags_Directory folder
                           if it doesn't exist. If it does exist, the file will
                           be opened and any log writes will be appended to it.
        
        #bool
        Allow_Corrupt ---- Enables returning corrupt tags rather than discarding
                           them and reporting the exception. Instead, the
                           exception will be printed to the console and the tag
                           will be returned like normal. For debugging use only.
        Check_Extension -- Whether or not(when indexing tags) to make sure a
                           tag's extension also matches the extension for that
                           Cls_ID. The main purpose is to prevent loading temp
                           files. This is only useful when overloading the
                           constructors 'Get_Cls_ID' function since the default
                           constructor verifies tags by their extension.
        Write_as_Temp ---- Whether or not to keep tags as temp files when
                           calling self.Write_Tags. Overridden by supplying
                           'Temp' as a keyword when calling self.Write_Tags.
        Backup_Old_Tags -- Whether or not to backup a file that exists with the
                           same name as a tag that is being saved. The file will
                           be renamed with the extension '.backup'. If a backup
                           already exists then the oldest backup will be kept.
                           
        #dict
        Tag_Collection --- A dict of dicts which holds every loaded tag. A
                           dict inside the Tag_Collection holds all of a single
                           type of tag, with each of the tags keyed by their
                           tag path, which is relative to self.Tags_Directory.
                           Accessing a tag is done like so:
                           Tag_Collection[Cls_ID][Tag_Path] = Tag_Obj

        #iterable
        Valid_Tag_IDs ---- Some form of iterable containing the Cls_ID strings
                           that this Handler and its Tag_Constructer will
                           be working with. You may instead provide a single
                           Cls_ID string if working with just one kind of tag.
